# SDSC23_NYC_lowcode

Welcome to "Low Code Flow: Using CARTO Workflows for low code repeatable spatial analytics"

Some things you need to know:
* It is HIGHLY recommended you use the CARTO organization specific to this event. The data needed to follow along with this workshop are stored in a BigQuery instance that is ONLY accessible from that CARTO organization.
* You should have received an email inviting you to a CARTO organization specific to this event. Please follow the steps in that email -  and make sure you check your spam if you can't find it.
* If you don't have an email invitation, please email marketing@carto.com and they should be able to help.
* If you already have your own CARTO account, please let me know so I can issue you a new invite with an alias (email+sdsc@gmail.com, for example) so you can access the org.

## The workshop agenda
The workshop is broken into three parts:
* An overview of Workflows and its capabilities
* A follow along session where we'll all build a workflow together
* An exploratory session where there will be a challenge to complete

# SDSC Conference Workshops

Welcome to the SDSC Conference Workshops repository! Here, you will find information about the sessions. Please explore each of the individual folders for information and datasets relating to each of the individual workshops.


## CARTO Workshop Sessions

### Enable Serverless Geospatial Analytics and Machine Learning with AWS and CARTO
**Presenter:** Sohaib Katariwala, Analytics Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS

With continuous growth in the size of datasets and declining cost of storage, it’s becoming more common to use a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift for geospatial datasets. With AWS Data Exchange, you can find and subscribe to third-party data sets and seamlessly query them alongside your first party data in Amazon Redshift. In Amazon Redshift you can use spatial joins, built-in spatial functions, and machine learning models on your data directly in Amazon Redshift using SQL which analysts are already familiar with. By keeping the data in Amazon Redshift you can benefit from the best price-performance of any cloud data warehouse. With the geospatial capabilities enabled in Amazon Redshift, combined with the tools from CARTO, it’s possible to solve most spatial use cases natively in the cloud.

### Blank spaces: Using Geosegmentation & Financial Data
**Presenter:** Helen McKenzie, Geospatial Advocate at CARTO

Helen McKenzie dives into the world of geosegmentation and financial data, revealing how you can identify locations that would benefit most from the "Swift Effect." Gain insights into the power of combining geospatial analytics with financial data. Access the materials in the github folder marked Geosegmentation.


### Taming Big Data with Spatial Indexing
**Presenter:** Aaron Fraint, Senior Solutions Engineer at CARTO

In this workshop, Aaron Fraint shares strategies for taming big data using spatial indexing. Discover techniques to efficiently manage and query large geospatial datasets. Access the materials in the github folder marked taming-big-data-with-spatial-indexes.


### Low Code Flow: Using CARTO Workflows for Low Code Repeatable Spatial Analytics
**Presenter:** Zachary Walker, Solutions Engineer at CARTO

Zachary Walker presents low code workflows for repeatable spatial analytics using CARTO. Learn how to streamline your geospatial analytics workflows for efficiency and reproducibility. Access the materials in the github folder marked Low code flow.


### Mastering Geospatial Analytics using Snowflake and CARTO
**Presenter:** Venkatesh Seka, Principal Data Cloud Architect at Snowflake & Tomas Ehrenfeld, Senior Solutions Engineer at CARTO

Venkatesh Seka provides a comprehensive guide to mastering geospatial analytics with Snowflake and CARTO. Learn how to leverage these tools to unlock valuable insights from your geospatial data.

### From Data to Action: Decision Science for Accelerated Business Results
**Presenter:** Kadir Karakus, Head of Data at Echo Analytics

Mobility data alone doesn’t provide much value unless it’s analysed and transformed into actionable insights. Technical difficulties for data cleaning and processing, and the expertise needed to extract customer behaviour from mobility data can be a real pain - but once mastered it is a game changer for businesses. In this hands-on workshop attendees will work on a real-world use case and learn about the necessary tools to drive business decisions. During the workshop, attendees will download Echo's mobility data and will work on Python, Geopandas and a Jupyter notebook to successfully master their analysis of mobility insights.

### Deeper, Broader, Faster, Stronger: Expanding into new dimensions with spatiotemporal data
**Presenter:** Robert Edwards, Senior Data Scientist & Joshua Bramall, Head of Data Science At General System

Spatial data that changes over time presents difficulties because of the cost, time, and complexity to process and analyze at scale.  But this data holds valuable, latent and undiscovered insights that can make your analysis deeper (historically), broader (spatially), faster (analytically), and stronger! 

Join us for a fun and interactive session with Josh and Robert, senior data scientists who specialise in working with global-scale, spatiotemporal datasets. In this session, you'll use CARTO, Python and other familiar technologies to explore and overcome some of the most complex and challenging examples of geospatial analysis, get a glimpse into the future of geospatial data science and pocket some actionable takeaways.

### Spatial Data Science with PySAL: An Introduction to Geodemographic Segmentation and Urban Economic Structure
**Presenter:** Eli Knaap, Senior Research Scientist & Associate Director at SDSU Center for Open Geographical Science

This tutorial provides an introduction to urban spatial analysis using PySAL and geosnap, demonstrating how to use spatial data science to uncover market areas in the city for both residential and employment markets. The tutorial first introduces geodemographic segmentation and regionalization as techniques for understanding the consumer structure of a metropolitan region, and then introduces the combination of spatial autocorrelation measures with computational geometry as a method for uncovering employment market areas in the city. These analytics can be used to better understand the existing and emerging "spatial structure" of a city, identify targeted uses in different portions of the region, and coordinate the co-location of other goods and services like transportation and accommodation.

### A Data-Driven Approach to Flooding & Climate Risk Design to Enhance Supply Chain Network Resilience
**Presenter:** Gavin Lewis, Head of Engineering at Fathom & Tomas Ehrenfeld, Senior Solutions Engineer at CARTO

Over 125 billion dollars were lost in damage due to Hurricane Harvey. Whether you are in the Retail, Logistics, Energy, Insurance or many other sectors, extreme weather events cause major losses due to asset damage, failure in supply chain, etc. In this workshop we will demonstrate how to use a data driven approach for designing a supply chain network that is resilient to weather extremes both for the current climate state and also under future climate scenarios and time horizons. We will also explore how to identify the assets at risk due to real weather events for emergency response planning and impact analysis. Access the materials in the github folder marked Flooding.


### ML on the Edge: Training models for Remote and On-Orbit Earth Observation
**Presenter:** James McClain, Machine Learning Lead & Matt Bialas, Senior Software Engineer at element84

Thousands of Earth Observation (EO) satellites are flying overhead, thanks to the SmallSat revolution. With space-to-ground bandwidth struggling to keep pace, availability windows come at a premium. In this workshop, you'll explore the benefits of pre-processing data using Python to train a Machine Learning (ML) model that pre-select only high-quality imagery for downlink. The model will be lightweight, and capable of running on off-the-shelf, space-ready hardware.

### ML on the Edge: Planet-scale spatial analysis with Google EarthEngine and BigQuery
**Presenter:** Jeremy Malczyk, Cloud Geographer at Google

This workshop will walk through using recently launched capabilities in Google Earth Engine, Vertex AI, and Big Query to gain insights from remote sensing and geospatial data. We'll walk through common use cases and patterns for moving data between the services, and best practices for their use.  Users will get hands-on experience implementing common geospatial workflows and approaches that can be used for solving problems in conservation, climate risk, and natural resource management among many others.
